    <h2>Chicken riggies is a specialty dish from Utica, New York. Rigatoni (riggies) pasta is paired with chicken and spicy peppers in a creamy red and white sauce. Some other popular additions are mushrooms and black olives!</h2>
    <h1>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>1 (16 ounce) package rigatoni pasta</ul>
    <ul>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</ul>
    <ul>1½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast, cut in bite-sized pieces</ul>
    <ul>salt and ground black pepper to taste</ul>
    <ul>1 onion, diced</ul>
    <ul>2 Cubanelle peppers, seeded and thinly sliced</ul>
    <ul>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</ul>
    <ul>3 roasted red peppers, drained and chopped</ul>
    <ul>2 hot cherry peppers, seeded and minced</ul>
    <ul>½ cup heavy cream</ul>
    <ul>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>Bring a large pot of slightly salted water to a boil over high heat. Add rigatoni pasta and cook until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and keep warm.</ol>
    <ol>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Season chicken with salt and pepper; cook in hot oil until lightly browned on all sides and no longer pink in the center, about 7 minutes. Remove chicken from the skillet and keep warm.</ol>
    <ol>Stir onion, Cubanelle peppers, and garlic into the skillet. Cook and stir until onion softens, about 4 minutes. Add crushed tomatoes, roasted red peppers, and hot cherry peppers; bring to a simmer. Stire in cooked chicken and heavy cream; simmer for 2 to 3 minutes.</ol>
    <ol>Stir in pasta, then garnish with Parmesan cheese.</ol>

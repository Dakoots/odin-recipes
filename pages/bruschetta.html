    <h1>Bruschetta</h1>
    <img src="../images/index.jpeg">
    <h2><p>Pronounced <em>"brusketta",</em> this classic Italian appetizer is a perfect way to capture the flavors of garden ripened tomatoes, fresh basil, garlic, and olive oil. Think of it as summer on toast!</p></h2>
        <h2>Indgredients</h2>
        <ul>6 to 7 ripe tomatoes</ul>
        <ul>2 cloves garlic, minced</ul>
        <ul>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</ul>
        <ul>1 teaspoon balsalmic vinegar</ul>
        <ul>6 to 8 fresh basil leaves, thinly sliced or chopped</ul>
        <ul>3/4 teaspoon sea salt, more or less to taste</ul>
        <ul>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, more or less to taste</ul>
        <ul>1 baguette, French bread, or similar Italian bread</ul>
        <ul>1/4 cup olive oil</ul> 
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>Bring 2 quarts of water to a boil. As the water is heating, make shallow cuts in a cross pattern at the tip ends of the tomatoes. Once the water is boiling, remove the pot from the heat. Put scored tomatoes in the hot water and blanch for 1 minute.</ol> 
        <ol>Remove with a slotted spoon and let sit until cool enough to handle. Then gently peel off the tomato skins. Cut out the stem base with a paring knife.</ol>
        <ol>Cut the tomatoes into halves or quarters and squeeze out most of the juices and seeds.</ol>  
        <ol>Preheat oven to 450째F(230째C) with a rack in the top slot of the oven.</ol>
        <ol>Finely chop the tomatoes and place them in a medium bowl. Mix in the minced garlic, 1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil, and the balsalmic vinegar.</ol>
        <ol>Stir in the thinly sliced basil and add salt and freshly ground black pepper, adding more to taste.</ol>
        <ol>Use a bread knife to slice the baguette on the diagonal making half-inch thick slices. Brush one side of each slice with olive oil(a pastry brush helps here) and place olive oil-side down on a baking sheet or roasting pan.</ol>
        <ol>The baguette slices will toast best in the top of your oven, so you may need to work in batches to toast them all.</ol>
        <ol>When the oven has reached 450째F(230째C) place the slices in the oven on the top rack and toast for 5 to 6 minutes until lightly browned around the edges.</ol>
        <ol>Arrange the toasted bread on a platter, olive oil side facing up(the olive oil will help create a temporary barrier keeping the bread from getting soggy from the chopped tomatoes).</ol>
        <ol>Either serve the toasts plain with a bowl of the tomato bruschetta mixture on the side for people to top their own, or use a spoon to gently top each toasted bread slice with some of the tomato mixture. If you top each slice individually, do it right before serving.</ol>
